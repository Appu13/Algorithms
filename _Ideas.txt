Vowel Con:
    
Weakness:
    it only replaces the vowels so if hackers spend some they can rebuild the key

Improvement:
    We find the common pairing of vowels and consonets and replace them


RANDOM IDEAS
we can make a program to generate a random key 
we can store the key in a location in the user pc
we can read from that location import it to the encrpytion and decrpytion module
Possible problem:
    Over complication
    can fk up the reading and storing
    hackers can find the key generation program or the key itself
